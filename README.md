# Ros-Myo Bridge

Developed from [a fork](https://github.com/mstiller7/MMIyo) of [Open-Myo](https://github.com/Alvipe/Open-Myo), this repository contains the working code to transmit readings from a Myo armband device and translate these into signals understood by ROS.

Place this directory into your ROS `catkin_ws` workspace folder, and make it with ROS in order to run `wheelchair_command.py` as a ROS node.
